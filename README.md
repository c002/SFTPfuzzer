# SFTPfuzzer
SFTPfuzzer (Simple FTP Fuzzer) is a very simple software written in Python 2.7 (by 0x8b30cc), that allows you to easily fuzz username and password field in an FTP Server, looking for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
SFTPfuzzer is written in a very simple way, and the code is well commented, allowing you to easily understand what is going on and easily edit the software. The code is licensed under GNU General Public License (GPL v3)

I recenlty added parentheses in print calls, allowing you to run this script also on python3 (or >)
